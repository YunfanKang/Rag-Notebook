It aims to democratize access to HPC resources and enable domain scientists in various fields, including social and environmental sciences, to solve computationally intensive problems.\\n\\nCyberGIS provides a middleware toolkit called CyberGIS-Compute, which allows domain experts to create containerized software environments for their models without requiring extensive technical knowledge of HPC or containerization technologies. This enables users to execute their models on HPC resources, such as science gateways, and provides consistent software environments across different computing platforms.\\n\\nSome key features of CyberGIS include:\\n\\n1. Containerization: CyberGIS-Compute uses containerization technologies like Docker and Singularity to create isolated software environments for domain-specific models.\\n2. Middleware: CyberGIS acts as a middleware layer between HPC resources and the domain-specific models, simplifying the process of integrating models with HPC resources.\\n3. Science gateways: CyberGIS integrates with science gateways, which are platforms that provide access to computational resources and facilitate collaboration among researchers in various fields.\\n4. Reproducibility: CyberGIS enables reproducibility by providing a consistent software environment for domain-specific models, making it easier to replicate results and collaborate with others.\\n\\nCyberGIS has been applied to various fields, including emergency evacuation simulation, spatial agent-based modeling, precision agriculture, and more.

       " 'Title: Computer Science and Programming Courses in Geography Departments in the United States\\nContent: Geographic information systems (GIS) are fundamental information technologies. The capabilities and applications of GIS continue to rapidly expand, requiring practitioners to have new skills and competencies, especially in computer science. There is little research, however, about how best to prepare the next generation of GIScientists with adequate computer science skills. This article explores how U.S. geography departments are introducing and developing computer science and programming skills in their geography and GIS degree programs. We review the degree requirements in fifty-five geography departments and discover that forty-four of them offer some kind of GIS programming course. Of the 210 separate degree options identified, however, only 22 require one of these courses for a degree. There is little consistency or emphasis on computer science and programming skills in geography or GIS degrees, despite the immense importance of these components in geography and GIS careers. We propose future research along distinct investigative tracks to build a research-based understanding of the educational interactions among GIS, computer science, programming, and geography.\\nContributor: Forrest J.

These measurements were gathered through field campaigns conducted in 15 countries spanning 47 years. In contrast to its prior version, Globe-LFMC 2.0 incorporates over 120,000 additional data entries, introduces more than 800 new sampling sites, and comprises LFMC values obtained from samples collected until the calendar year 2023. Each entry within the dataset provides essential information, including date, geographical coordinates, plant species, functional type, and, where available, topographical details. Moreover, the dataset encompasses insights into the sampling and weighing procedures, as well as information about land cover type and meteorological conditions at the time and location of each sampling event. Globe-LFMC 2.0 can facilitate advanced LFMC research, supporting studies on wildfire behaviour, physiological traits, ecological dynamics, and land surface modelling, whether remote sensing-based or otherwise. This dataset represents a valuable resource for researchers exploring the diverse LFMC aspects, contributing to the broader field of environmental and ecological research.\\nContributor: Yi Qi\\n',\n",
